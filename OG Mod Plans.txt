[Not everything in this needs to be fulfilled]

The Beacon
In the abrupt wake of night, an agile slugcat with strange luminosity makes their prescence known.
Take your lights and journey across this forgotten landscape for answers.

Body: #2a04dc
Eyes: #ffffff

Slugcat Perks
- Insectivore + "Dark" creatures.
- Rivulet-like stats.
- Nocturnal, waking up during nighttime exclusively, or rather any time nowadays.
- Can put flashbangs around their neck to store them.
- Has Artificer's pyro abilities but taking on a flare bomb theme.
	- pyrojump with purple visuals
	- parry a literal flashbang explosion,
	- swallowing rubbish turns it into a flarebomb on regurgitation (1 pip)
	- turns spears into electric spears (1 pip)

Black Centipede (Scaleless Red Centipede)
- Attempts to stay away when at max flashbangs stored.
- In pursuit when you have no flashbangs stored.

The Photomaniac
A maniacal juvenile seeking its older sibling, possessing the same luminosity. 
It's electrical abilities, though ill wielded, give it a tactical advantage

Body: #2a04dc
Eyes: #ffffff

Slugcat Perks
- Insectivore + "Dark" creatures.
- Turns spears into electric spears (1 pip)
- Has a shockwave ability that is activated in the same way as arti's blast jump/stun blast
	- upon activation, creates a flash of light identical to a flare bomb explosion
	- also creates a short ranged shockwave that knocks enemies back and electrocutes them, dealing negligible damage
	- after use, the player is stunned for a bit, unable to move

World Changes
- The Void Sea has abruptly vanished, leaving the iterators without a fuel source after their creators dissapearance.
- Uses Spearmaster's worldstate for LTTM & FP to be still standing.
- LTTM & FP's can's are lifeless, and their puppets rest at the floor of their chamber.
- "Nighttime" will be simulated by shading the world. (Dark World)
- Flashangs and "Dark" creatures can be found in more regions. (modifying spawns and dev tools objects)
     - Most will be placed in SU, HI, SH, SB before Depths, UW & SS, LM & DM, CC, and LF. [already started]
(maybe) - Creature recolors similar to HR's gold variants; Grey/White highlights.

- Region/Subregion renames to fit with this dark world:
SU -> Alleyways
HI -> Lightless Complex
CC -> Solitary Towers
DS -> Empty Ducts
GW -> Dimlit Wasteland
SH -> Silent Citadel
VS -> Solemn Drillsite
LM -> Defunct District
SI -> Skyhigh Spires
LF -> Barren Plains
UW -> Quiet Exterior
SS -> Five Pebbles
SB -> Silenced Subterranean
     - Depths -> Pitch Black
     - Filtration System -> 
DM -> Looks To The Moon
	 - Memory Conflux -> Silent Chambers
	 - Luna -> The Peak
	 - Neural Terminus -> Comatic Conduits

Depths (Pitch Black)
- Completely dark, you would need external light sources to see.
- While in the final part of Depths, it gets colder the closer you get to SB_L01.
    - If you jump into the chasm you just fall forever, then the campaign ends.
- the subregion would have no distortion effect because the void sea is gone.


Scope Creep Ending Sequence
A new connection in SB_D01 is present, leading into two new rooms, a caved in access shaft, and a severely damaged puppet chamber.
entering the chamber prompts the campaign to end as you've returned to your creator, now finding home inside of Pitch Black's abandoned
puppet chamber with a good amount of flare bombs planted inside (cause they're so cool).

Ending art is similar to spearmaster's, with The Beacon resting alongside Pitch Black's puppet in the chamber, this is actually a memory of the past.
- Pitch Black housing the remains of a long collapsed iterator doesn't need to happen, another ending can be thought up!
- SB_D01 would have an alt for beacon that has that connection to Pitch Black's access shaft and puppet chamber instead of being a new connection to the original room

MILLISEC'S COOL WORLD CHANGES -- (alternate idea to the whole of the subterranean/depths changes)

BYGONE VACUITY
	- Uprooted Underbelly
	- Amalgamted Nodes
	- Nadir

This reigon will entirely replace subterranean, being a fusion between an upside-down wreckage of an iterator superstructure and the various areas in subterranean

The entrances will persist of a fusion between the regular entrances to sub and the ruins of a leg subreigon, except for the pipeyard and drainage system entrances, which are collapsed within their respective reigons and are inaccessible

Uprooted Underbelly
- this will be the regular sub landscape, being very horizontal, but also combined with a ruined upside-down underhang
- leads to Amalgamated Nodes

Amalgamated Nodes
- combination of filtration system and iterator shit
- leads to unlabeled part of reigon which blocks off access shaft to depths

Unlabeled Part Of Reigon
- the ruined insides of an iterator, also being able to glimpse the ruins of the wall in some rooms, although sparce since its completely buried
- Leads around amalgamated nodes and back to the depths access shaft (although ruined). going down it will lead to nadir

Nadir
- Combination of depths and the upper parts of an iterator, although there is a lot less machinery than prior areas as its all spread out and fallen all over due to depths' open areas
- starts out as normal depths until you get to SB_A14, which is collapsed and has a giant metal beam running through it that you need to climb, to enter the ruins of depths and an iterator
- you venture downward until you get to SB_L01, which is very ruined as has a single iterator chamber in the middle. inside is pitch black.
- this entire area is overgrown with flashbangs, having many in SB_L01, including pitch black's chamber

PHOTOMANIAC EXCLUSIVE WORLD CHANGES -- subject to change

upon meeting pitch black, the beacon is not present. pitch black directs you to a nearby karma gate, buried under the ruins, that leads to a new reigon. Pitch black tells you that is where the beacon resides

the karma gate in question leads to---------

CAPSIZED MEGAOPOLIS

- this reigon is contained entirely in the empty cavity that the void sea once resided in. It's very similar to metropolis except upside down and very ruined
- at some point in the city you will find the beacon what happens after is tbd (we'll have to discuss it (that is if you are even happy with these ideas))

thanks for watching like subcride
