[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: Scared to death of the Night Terror chasing you?<LINE>We had something scarier happen early in the BETA of the mod
Lurzard: See, mods already accumulate memory over time resulting in crashes, moreso than the base game.<LINE>Now that Downpour is out it's quite normal to experience a crash when sheltering after a few hours of playing.
Lurzard: I experienced these crashes very often in gameplay because I'd play for like the entire<LINE>day and just let my game accumulate memory, but this was before I started work on PB even.
Lurzard: At some point the Night Terror became memory-hungry, they weren't clearing<LINE>references and that made the memleak that was already apparent so much worse!
Lurzard: The mod and practically the entire game was rendered as unplayable because of this, We were devestated.
Lurzard: Thank god that's over now :3

Relay Terminated.
