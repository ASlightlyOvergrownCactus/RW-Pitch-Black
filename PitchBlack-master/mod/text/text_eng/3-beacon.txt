Where did it go?

The storm that plagued the surface for seemingly endless cycles.

These fields are barren, dead...

The grass hungered and you left it to starve, sleeping storm.

The clouds linger, you could make it rain once more!

Is this a punishment for me? To watch my fields suffer the same?

I can do nothing but watch, If only I could, I'd be crying.
