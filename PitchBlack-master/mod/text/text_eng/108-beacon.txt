You are burdenedâ€¦ A tormentor lurks outside, unable to follow you into here.

I've watched it chase you throughout this undergrowth.

Narrowly escaping its grasp, failing to do so, attempting to fight it off proved futile.

As long as I'm here it can't get to you, You are safe with me.

But it will never leave, this moment is yours to relax after all this time running.

Cherish this moment of peace, bright one.
