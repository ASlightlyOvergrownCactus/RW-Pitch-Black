You are burdenedâ€¦ A tormentor lurks outside, unable to follow you into here.

I've watched it chase you throughout this undergrowth.

Narrowly escaping its grasp, failing to do so, attempting to fight it off proved futile.

It will never leave, this moment is yours to rest after all this time running.

Cherish it, bright one.
