[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: I honestly have no idea when the campaigns of this mod would take place if it was somehow canon.
Lurzard: But I mainly base theming around Spearmaster.
Lurzard: Some say Rivulet, honestly not sure about that!
Lurzard: And it absolutely cannot be Saint because then our iterators would've collapsed, it's just been so long with them standing.
Lurzard: I imagine their supports would give out at some point just being a limp can on top of stilts.
Lurzard: It doesn't have to fit on the current timeline, it already fits on its own.
Lurzard: But the original concept was that it took place around what would be Spearmaster so there you go. 

Relay Terminated.
