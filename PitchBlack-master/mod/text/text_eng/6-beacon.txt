A little beast?

What are you doing here? This is not the place to seek refuge.

If you choose to venture deeper, don't listen to their calls, their wails and screams, it's not as you think.

It's too late to save those below, they have been abandoned by their god the same as us.

The rubicon has been breached, and this is the aftermath.

The void yearns for you, but don't go any closer.
