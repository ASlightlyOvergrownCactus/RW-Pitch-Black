[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: Now this was fairly popular at the time of the beta but I'll relay it to you, just cryptic.
Lurzard: There were disconnections of a region, because it was unintentional to end the campaign that way, or to even go there.
Lurzard: People would seek this unintentional ending despite us explicitly telling them not to, they expected something special.
Lurzard: They got it.
Lurzard: And if you revisit those railways, I completely remixed them as a treat for those who want to go poking in places they don't belong. 

Relay Terminated.
