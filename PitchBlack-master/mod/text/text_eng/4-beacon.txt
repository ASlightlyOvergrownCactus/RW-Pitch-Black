Little creature, too bright for you?

come from below the clouds, a sunless landscape...

Meanwhile this constant sunrise is all we see up here, accompanied by the rushing wind.

Scorching the distant horizon forevermore.

Any closer, and the very god we’re on would be melted to slag.

I’m uncertain what this cycle will bring, tread carefully.
