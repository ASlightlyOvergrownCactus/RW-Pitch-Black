[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: People flipped out when they saw this man dead on entry.
Lurzard: It was so funny seeing people be just absolutely flabbergasted like "what."
Lurzard: Sure the rot was telling but I don't think they understood just how bad the it's gotten in here.
Lurzard: He's been completely engulfed by the rot, fate sealed.
Lurzard: Why is the rot purple? Just a worse case of it, inspired on how TLLs are colored.
Lurzard: If you didn't come with the mark you wouldn't have a way to obtain it, Though it's not like you can utilize it.

Relay Terminated.
