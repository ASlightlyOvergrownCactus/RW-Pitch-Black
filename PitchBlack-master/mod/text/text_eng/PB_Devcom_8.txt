[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: Our worldstate is very unique, it really cements the idea of a new story.
Lurzard: With what would otherwise be so many conflicting plot points just fits together so well.
Lurzard: Five Pebbles has morphed into The Rot,<LINE>at the time where Looks to the Moon is still standing,<LINE>when Drainage System has already morphed into Undergrowth,<LINE>as Subterranean has ripped open--
Lurzard: It's so much better than just copying Saint's!
Lurzard: However it did cause problems for Expedition, something about removing<LINE>story regions... must've been the fact that we disconnected SB for the beta. 

Relay Terminated.
