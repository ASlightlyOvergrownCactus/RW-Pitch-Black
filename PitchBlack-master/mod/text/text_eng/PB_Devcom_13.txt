[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: Originally the pursuer would work differently, like you could actually become immune to it.
Lurzard: if you had less than max Flashbangs stored they would actively pursue you.
Lurzard: But if you had max Flashbangs stored they'd just stop pursuing you!
Lurzard: It's much better now imo, I like how closely it references the Pursued Burden Centipede.
Lurzard: Itself, albeit in a different time. 

Relay Terminated.
