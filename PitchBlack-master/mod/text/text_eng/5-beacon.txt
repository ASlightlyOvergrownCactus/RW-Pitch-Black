Stepping out of the void to meet me?

I've turned pale, lost my gilded identity.

Perhaps I have been allowed to give up identity completely?

I don't wish to be forgotten, but I can't recall who I was, without my gold I'm no one.

My memories are kept here, just beyond reach. If I had a prison of flesh like yours I could achieve them...
