[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: This is a tribute to blujai!
Lurzard: They made content about the mod on YouTube, even streamed playing through the full beta!
Lurzard: It was very surreal to be honest, other people enjoying just the beta<LINE>version of this mod, so excited and encouraging us to continue developing it.
Lurzard: If you are seeing this commentary right now, it means we did it. 

Relay Terminated.
