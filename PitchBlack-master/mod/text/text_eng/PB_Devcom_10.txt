[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Relay.

Lurzard: If you haven't found out already, there is no day night cycle in this world.
Lurzard: At first we did plan for daytime to be at the end of the cycle, hell you'd have a sort of<LINE>Blizzard-like mechanic that was instead themed around Cold management and constant heat damage.
Lurzard: That was far too ambitious, and made making compat for modded regions incredibly tedious.
Lurzard: You are able to find relics of that in room settings, due to the method we used to remove it from the mod. 

Relay Terminated.
