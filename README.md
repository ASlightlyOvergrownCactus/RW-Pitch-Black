PB was made with usage of the SlugBase mod template, you can use it too [here](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugTemplate)!


This is the BETA release of Rain World: Pitch Black, a mod for Rain World.

It's a little expansion meant to shatter what you know about Rain World.

Play the Beacon or Photomaniac, two new nocturnal Slugcats that strayed too far from home into dangerous territory.


See the mod's [wiki page](https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitch_Black) for more information.

Download the mod on the [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032862920)

It's not recommended to download PB directly from the GitHUb repository unless you own the Downpour DLC for the game.
Playing the mod without the Downpour DLC will cause big issues, we warned you!


Enjoy the mod, it's still actively in development so check often for new content!
