[Not everything in this needs to be fulfilled]

The Beacon
In the abrupt wake of night, an agile slugcat with strange luminosity makes their prescence known.
Take your lights and journey across this forgotten landscape for answers.

Slugcat Perks
- Insectivore + "Dark" creatures.
- Rivulet-like stats.
- Nocturnal, waking up during nighttime exclusively, or rather any time nowadays.
- Can put flashbangs around their neck to store them.
- Has Artificer's pyro abilities but taking on a flare bomb theme.
	- pyrojump with purple visuals
	- parry a literal flashbang explosion,
	- swallowing rubbish turns it into a flarebomb on regurgitation (1 pip)
	- turns spears into electric spears (1 pip)

Black Centipede (Scaleless Red Centipede)
- Attempts to stay away when at max flashbangs stored.
- In pursuit when you have no flashbangs stored.

World Changes
- The Void Sea has abruptly vanished, leaving the iterators without a fuel source after their creators dissapearance.
- Uses Spearmaster's worldstate for LTTM & FP to be still standing.
- LTTM & FP's can's are lifeless, and their puppets rest at the floor of their chamber.
- "Nighttime" will be simulated by shading the world. (Dark World)
- Flashangs and "Dark" creatures can be found in more regions. (modifying spawns and dev tools objects)
     - Most will be placed in SU, HI, SH, SB before Depths, UW & SS, LM & DM, CC, and LF. [already started]
(maybe) - Creature recolors similar to HR's gold variants; Grey/White highlights.

- Region/Subregion renames to fit with this dark world:
SU -> Alleyways
HI -> Lightless Complex
CC -> Solitary Towers
DS -> Empty Ducts
GW -> Dimlit Wasteland
SH -> Silent Citadel
VS -> Solemn Drillsite
LM -> Defunct District
SI -> Skyhigh Spires
LF -> Barren Plains
UW -> Quiet Exterior
SS -> Five Pebbles
SB -> Silenced Subterranean
     - Depths -> Pitch Black
     - Filtration System -> 
DM -> Looks To The Moon
	 - Memory Conflux -> Silent Chambers
	 - Luna -> The Peak
	 - Neural Terminus -> Comatic Conduits

Depths (Pitch Black)
- Completely dark, you would need external light sources to see.
- While in the final part of Depths, it gets colder the closer you get to SB_L01.
    - If you jump into the chasm you just fall forever, then the campaign ends.
- the subregion would have no distortion effect because the void sea is gone.


Scope Creep Ending Sequence
A new connection in SB_D01 is present, leading into two new rooms, a caved in access shaft, and a severely damaged puppet chamber.
entering the chamber prompts the campaign to end as you've returned to your creator, now finding home inside of Pitch Black's abandoned
puppet chamber with a good amount of flare bombs planted inside (cause they're so cool).

Ending art is similar to spearmaster's, with The Beacon resting alongside Pitch Black's puppet in the chamber, this is actually a memory of the past.
- Pitch Black housing the remains of a long collapsed iterator doesn't need to happen, another ending can be thought up!
- SB_D01 would have an alt for beacon that has that connection to Pitch Black's access shaft and puppet chamber instead of being a new connection to the original room
